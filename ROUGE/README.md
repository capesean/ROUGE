# ROUGE (C#)

ROUGE, or Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, is a set of metrics used for evaluating automatic summarization and machine translation software in natural language processing. The metrics compare an automatically produced summary or translation against a reference or a set of references (human-produced) summary or translation.

This repository contains the class library 'ROUGE', which is a C# implementation of the ROUGE metric, and a 'Console App' which runs a simple test and outputs the results (scores).
